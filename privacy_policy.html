                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>SurveySync is Software as a Service (SaaS) based company that provides its clients tools to conduct two-way communication with their customers, employees, suppliers, and constituents. At SurveySync, protecting the privacy of our clients, survey participants, and visitors is a core business principle. Like the postal service, we understand that the information we deliver belongs to our clients and their survey participants, not us.</p>
                        
                    <p>Our practices stated in this Privacy Policy are applicable worldwide. SurveySync is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. We may share information between SurveySync entities and transfer it between our offices around the world. Some countries may provide less legal protection for personal information than the country in which the information was obtained. Even if a country does not have stringent requirements for protecting your privacy, we still handle information in the manner described here.</p>
                        
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by SurveySync on our website at the URL https://www.SurveySync.com/ (the “Site”), our SurveySync service platform owned and operated by SurveySync LLC (“SurveySync”, “we”, “us”, “our”), and any other service or product provided by SurveySync that explicitly specifies the applicability of this Privacy Policy (collectively, “Service(s)”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to data collected on third party websites, apps, or services, or the use of SurveySync’s platform and services by third parties for collection of information, even if such third parties are SurveySync’s partners and display SurveySync branding on their websites, apps, or services. Data collected by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and practices. This Privacy Policy describes how SurveySync collects, receives, uses, stores, shares, discloses, transfers, and processes your personal information (collectively, “Process”, “Processed”, “Processing”), as well as your rights and choices in determining what we do with the information that we collect or hold about you. This Privacy Policy does not govern the Processing of non-personal or anonymized information by SurveySync.</p>
                        
            <p>This Privacy Policy is a part of SurveySync’s Terms of Service. If any word or phrase has been defined within the Terms of Service, but has not been defined within this Privacy Policy, that word or phrase shall have the meaning that has been assigned to it under the Terms of Service.</p>
                        
        <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@SurveySync.com.</p>
                        
                    <h2>1. What Information does SurveySync collect?</h2>
                        
                <p>SurveySync collects information about: (1) our customers (“Clients”); (2) the individuals who participate in, or are invited to participate in, any of our Clients’ surveys (“Survey Participants”); and (3) any visitor to our Site, apps, platforms, and Services, whether or not they are Clients, Survey Participants, or other visitors (collectively, “Visitors”). Collectively, the information collected about our Clients (“Client Information”), Survey Participants (“Participant Information”), and Visitors (“Visitor Information”) is referred to as “Information”.</p>
                        
                        <h3>1.1 All Visitors:</h3>
                        
                    <p>If you choose to use our referral service on SurveySync to share an article from our Service, we will ask you for your email address and your recipient’s email address. We will automatically send your recipient a one-time email in your name inviting him or her to visit the Site or Service to view the article.</p>
                <p>We collect certain information in accordance with the Section on “Cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies” below.</p>
            <p>If you share any personally identifiable information through comments or forms on our blog, forum, or public resources, it may be read, collected, or used by third parties to send unsolicited messages to you. You assume sole responsibility for the use of any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in public view. To request removal of your personal information from our blogs, forum, or public resources, contact us at privacy@SurveySync.com. In some cases, we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We encourage all users to exercise caution when providing personal information in blogs, forums, and public posts.</p>
        <p>You can import contacts from Gmail or other address books to invite other individuals to become SurveySync users. We do not collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts, and we only collect the contact email address for contacts that you select for that purpose.</p>
                        <h3>1.2 Clients:</h3>
                        
                    <p>When our Clients register on the Service, we ask for contact information including company name, name of contact, title of contact, telephone number, email address, User ID, password, and billing information which may include credit card numbers. We may ask our Clients to provide additional categories of information as mentioned in the sign-up form. Clients are required to provide us with Information that is necessary for us to provide our Services.</p>
                <p>                        Clients can log in to our Service using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, Google Sign-in, or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Information with us, such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Service to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
                        <h3>1.3 Survey Participants:</h3>
                        
                        <p>We receive Participant Information from both Clients and Survey Participants. Clients provide us with contact information such as email address, and sometimes additional details including the name of each Participant. Before receiving such Information, we contractually require Clients to warrant that they have a pre-existing relationship with the Survey Participant and/or the Survey Participant’s permission to receive electronic messages.
                        Survey Participants provide us with the Information requested by our Clients as well as all answers to the survey questions. Clients are the sole responsible party for the content of the surveys; We do not control the theme or questions asked in any survey. In order to enhance survey response rates, we track and record: (I) if and when a Survey Participant has responded to a survey and (ii) if and when a Survey Participant has received an invitation or a reminder to participate in a survey.</p>

The use of that specific Information will be limited to the use stated in the alternative disclosure.</p>
